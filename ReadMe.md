# SpellCasters

This is a game written in Lua for the [Pico-8 fantasy console](http://www.pico-8.com).

Use your magic wand to cast the 4 randomly-generated spells against the monsters. Each monster has a spell that it's weak to, so use that to your advantage! But don't take too long to cast your spell, or you'll lose it and have to re-enter it, which is bad, because you only have 3 hits before the monsters defeat you!
